## 🧠 What is Mudic?

**Mudic** is your AI-powered emotional wellness companion that listens to your feelings and responds with personalized care.  
The name comes from **“Mood + Music”**, and the app adapts its look, voice, and content to how you're feeling.

Whether you're sad, angry, anxious, or just tired — Mudic holds space for you.

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. **Mood Analysis**
The user enters how they’re feeling → Gemini AI processes the tone and returns:
- 🎭 A precise **mood label** (e.g., “tired”, “angry”)
- 🌈 A **motivational message** based on that mood
- 🖌️ A **pastel RGB color** for theming the UI

---

### 2. **Personalized Mood Pages**

Each mood unlocks a custom experience:

#### 😢 **Sad**
> Swipe through Gemini-generated *hilariously silly jokes* until your sadness gives up.

- Tinder-style card swiping
- Each swipe triggers a fresh AI joke
- Designed to surprise and amuse

#### 😡 **Angry**
> Vent freely, and let Gemini gently calm you down.

- Freeform text input
- Gemini responds with a soothing line
- Breathing animation and gentle UI to de-escalate stress

#### 😴 **Tired**
> (Coming soon) A cozy visual with AI-generated nap stories, mantras, and breathing cues.

- No user input required
- Minimal interaction for maximum comfort

#### 😊 **Happy**
> Celebrate your joy with a magical, 13-word haiku written just for you.

- Gemini haiku generation based on your input
- Delightful display on a soft, cheerful interface

## 💭 Why We Built Mudic

We noticed that even mood-tracking apps *ask too much* of users — especially when they’re already drained.  
Mudic flips the script. It listens, adapts, and lifts you up — one beautifully tailored moment at a time.

Built with care.  
For everyone who just needed to feel heard.
